An _$$n$$-manifold_ is a shape which looks locally like $$\TR^n$$. A 0-manifold is a point, a 1-manifold is a curve, a 2-manifold is a surface, and a 3-manifold is a region. Because of locality, a collection of disjoint $$n$$-manifolds is also an $$n$$-manifold (e.g. set of points, or a set of curves). Currently we use points for 0-manifolds, B-splines for 1-manifolds, Coons patches for 2-manifolds, and the closed volumes bounded by those Coons patches for 3-manifolds. It should be noted that these representations do not have a practical unified generalization; they do not work well together.
